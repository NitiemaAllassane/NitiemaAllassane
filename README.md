# 👋 Hi, I’m Nitiema !

I'm a **self-taught Frontend Web Developer** passionate about building **accessible**, **high-performance**, and **sustainable** digital experiences.  
I care deeply about **clean code structure**, **readability**, and the **user experience**.  
Every project is an opportunity for me to **learn**, **grow**, and **create with purpose**.

Currently, I’m exploring modern tools like **Svelte** while strengthening my core skills in **HTML/CSS**, **JavaScript**, and best practices such as the **BEM methodology**.
